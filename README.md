## File Descriptions

### Dictionary Filtering Based on Conditions
**File**: `DictionaryFilteringBasedOnConditions.py`  
Applies filtering conditions to dictionaries to extract specific key-value pairs based on criteria.

### Dictionary Merging with Comprehension
**File**: `DictionaryMergingWithComprehension.py`  
Merges multiple dictionaries using dictionary comprehension, providing an efficient way to combine data.

### Dictionary with Nested Structures
**File**: `DictionaryWithNestedStructures.py`  
Demonstrates handling dictionaries containing nested structures, like dictionaries within dictionaries or lists.

### List Comprehension with Conditional Nesting
**File**: `ListComprehensionWithConditionalNesting.py`  
Illustrates advanced list comprehension techniques with conditional statements nested within comprehensions.

### List of Tuples to Dictionary
**File**: `ListOfTuplesToDictionary.py`  
Converts a list of tuples into a dictionary, which can be useful for organizing data in a key-value structure.

### Nested Lists Operations
**File**: `NestedListsOperations.py`  
Explores different operations on nested lists, such as accessing, modifying, and iterating through nested elements.

### Set Comprehension with Condition
**File**: `SetComprehensionWithCondition.py`  
Uses set comprehension with conditional logic to filter or modify sets based on certain criteria.

### Set Operations with Multiple Sets
**File**: `SetOperationsWithMultipleSets.py`  
Performs various set operations, including union, intersection, and difference on multiple sets.

### Tuple Comprehension using Generator
**File**: `TupleComprehensionUsingGenerator.py`  
Demonstrates tuple comprehension using generators for efficient, memory-friendly processing.

### Tuple Unpacking
**File**: `TupleUnpacking.py`  
Shows how to unpack tuples in Python, which can be useful in various scenarios such as assignments and function returns.
